# Meeting agenda for 10-17-2022

## Follow-Ups on Last Week's Meeting
- Is there any update on the virtual machine setup from last week?
- Will there be another meeting with Wade for our personal device VM set up?


## Progress
- What each of us worked on this past week:
    - Sydney: 
	    - Created team meeting minutes and team meeting agenda
    - Anshul: 
	    - Created a rough requirement goal for each milestone
    - Paul: 
	    - Created client meeting minutes
	    - Created TA meeting minutes
    - Mitch: 
	    - Created meeting agenda
    - Everyone: 
	    - Presentation slides
	    - Presentation video
	    - Create SSH key pair through PuTTY or terminal and submit the public key to Barb's repository
	    - All members set up local host MySQL on personal computer and set up Cisco AnyConnect VPN

## Drawbacks
- Slight delay on setting up virtual machines on personal devices as we ran into some issues setting up the server on Barb's computer during the meeting with Wade

## Questions
- What are the next steps/requirements for the project?
- Which requirements would you like us to get started on first?
- Is there a better way than Github issues to ask questions? Once we begin using the issues for bugs and the project itself, it may become a little confusing having questions and bugs mixed together.

## Next Steps
- Set up the virtual machine on our personal devices
- Create the high-level mock-ups on Figma for key webpages
- Discuss next steps of project
- Group will begin creating basic design mock-ups for the different webpages
- Refine requirement review to Barb's expectations
- Finalize requirements document
