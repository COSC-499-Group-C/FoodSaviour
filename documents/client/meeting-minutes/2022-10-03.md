# Client Meeting 03 October 2022

## Attendees
- Dr. Barb Marcolin
- Sydney Fang
- Mitch Hussack
- Anshul Dhariwal
- Paul Gray
- Group B

## Agenda
- Discuss which architecture seems best (Django vs Flask vs FastAPI)
- Get another demo of client website
- Ask questions relating to our requirements report
- Go over requirements slideshow

## General Meeting Notes
### General Project Goals and Discussion
- Must update landing page of website
- Minimal needed measures/trackers on site: Exercise duration/distance, intensity, steps, health measures (blood pressure, heart rate, height/weight), nutrition measures (diet, water), lifestyle measures (sleep, smoking habits), and wheel/push/motor measures
- All these measures will be different programs run by challenge groups (Lake Country Health, etc.)
- Users can join these groups/programs on the site
- Company or organizations can start up a challenge and invite people to join
- Privacy: Individual data, anonymous & aggregated data, group & aggregated data
    - Comply with certain data rules such as PIPEDA
- Multi-level value: Corporate/sponsor value, organizing value (groups/professional), individual value
- Save button for each individual tracker
- Consent, permission, and privacy options for trackers (with default values according to what professionals want)
- Week-long span for reporting measures/progress is ideal length
- Next/previous week buttons and an option to choose month is a critical requirement for trackers
- For professional view, show progress data graphically and textually
- User joins group/requests invite to a group; display weekly challenge charts and discussion board accordingly
- Page with all individual graphs/data vs individual pages for different activities/focuses
- Way to limit number of graphs displayed
- Will include the homeless section into Friends of Okanagan Rail Trail

### Target User Groups
- The people/groups mentioned in slides are the main users
- Individuals looking for challenges and activity, groups organizing events, non-profits, etc.
- Dwayne, rail trail, health professionals
    - eg. physiotherapists
- How user groups will use site:
    - Individual Users: Trackers, progress graphs and feedback, and weekly challenge comparisons and discussions
    - Organizations/Hosts: Create groups, track progress of group members and give feedback, and create challenges

### Functional Requirements
- Slides outline the general functional requirements
- Take from requirements document in shared repository
- Discussion board, document view for trail ambassadors, etc.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Slides outline some of the non-functional requirements
- Architecture will give us some non-functional requirements to talk about

### Exploration
- FastAPI has AsyncSQL that works directly with MySQL
- Django is bulky and is better for larger sites with lots of active users
- Otherwise Flask and FastAPI are better for smaller/lighter traffic sites

### Side Notes
- Barb created an overall repository for groups to put their code/documentation in for her
- ORT (Okanagan Rail Trail) provided a goal setting timeline challenge event
- ORT and Barb have a conversion formula to uniformize different methods of active travel (walk, bike, wheel)
- Users will be asked to participate in 2023 ORT challenges and to allow professionals to observe and assist them in learning how to transfer goals into a plan and activity
- UX - ask different users what path they take to interact with program (user flow)
- Need to cover all user flows for site to be successful
- Focus on few key flows and the rest will sort themselves out

## Final Decisions/Conclusions
- Terraform tool is no longer of interest

## Questions for Next Meeting
- Which architecture will we end up choosing to work with?
- What are the next steps for the project once all the requirements are sorted and decided on?
- Which charting tools should be used (based on what architecture we decide on)?
- How will the virtual environment be set up? Will we get a sandbox where our group can play around with the website on our own? (may be answered in Tech Lead meeting)

## Team Progress
- Created logs of agendas and meetings in GitHub repository
- Researched and compared different architectures and bug-tracking tools
- Signed and submitted temporary IP agreement

## Action Items
- Group will create rough draft of requirements report for Barb to review (10-05)
- Group will create requirements presentation and video (10-11)
- Anshul will find a time to meet with other tech leads to discuss and set up virtual machines
- Mitch will stay updated with anything client related
- Barb will look over Anshul's Django vs Flask vs FastAPI comparison and decide which one to use
- Group members may look into compatible charting tools and compare them
    - e.g D3JS.org, developers.google.com/charts
