## Agenda
- Set up virtual machines with Wade
- Discuss next steps of project

## General Meeting Notes
### General Project Goals and Discussion
- Set up Django (preferred architecture) environment on own local machine
- 1 virtual machine (VM) currently, but multiple IPs that can point to different things
- Currently unable to create separate VMs for each group since only 2 floating IPs (one is in use)
- On GoDaddy, create A record for website, then C names for all development group web servers and point them at site
- Create virtual hosts in Apache with root directory for each group
- Run server in Ubuntu 20.04
- Make sure virtual machine is NOT only place our code lives, save to group/overall GitHub repositories or on local machine
- Barb has prior test plans from previous site, will pull them out when we get closer to product and rearchitect them to work with new development
- Can create VM within infrastructure for project if current process does not work consistently

### Set-Up Process
- Create Volume named demortp_boot with Volume source of Image (Ubuntu-20.04.5-Focal-x64-2022-08), size of 20GB, and availability zone of Nova
    - Deleted, volume not needed
- Under instances, Launch Instance with same volume name (demortp), availability zone of Persistent-01
- Next select Boot Source as Image and populate with same Ubuntu 20.04 image
- Allocate p2-3gb Flavor
- Add key pairs for client and students
- Launch Instance
    - Error: No valid host was found
- Under Network > Floating IPs, Allocate IP to Project
- Public Network pool, healthenow.biz as DNS domain, demortp.healthenow.biz as DNS name
    - Error: Unable to allocate floating IP
- Problem is Arbutus Cloud (aka Compute Canada) ran out of hosts (overcommitting their resources)
- Problem with new governance (The Alliance), haven't been able to spend any money yet from funding

### Side Notes
- Barb deleted some old snapshots to free up cloud storage space
- Volume can increase from not rotating logs and excessive user data input and video/image files

## Final Decisions/Conclusions
- Use GitHub Issues primarily to communicate/ask questions with Barb

## Questions for Next Meeting
- What are the next steps/requirements for the project?

## Team Progress
- Created logs of agendas and meetings in GitHub repository
- Completed requirements presentation
- Created requirements report
- Set up local MySQL server through MySQL Workbench

## Action Items
- Group will recieve feedback from peers and finalize requirements report (10-21)
- Group will create ssh key pairs and submit public key to Barb's repository (10-17)
- Group will begin creating basic design mock-ups for the different webpages
- Barb will sort out VM with Wade and keep us updated
- Wade will investigate VM issues with Compute Canada
