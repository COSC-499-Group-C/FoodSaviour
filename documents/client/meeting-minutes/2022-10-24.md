## General Meeting Notes
### General Project Goals and Discussion
- Consent form at register page (what they chose will determine default for trackers)
- Register: first info/role, second consent, thrid extra info (based on role chose)
- Chose role(s) during sign up, admin will verify role and approve or deny
- Make simple graphic for timeline/progress bar, don't worry about clickable functionality for now
- Once registered, user should land on tracker home with health and wellness measures
- Have fixed order for trackers, be able to hide/bring back trackers
- Option at top to re-add/add more trackers
- Need a scroll bar for trackers
- Show graphs for all added trackers
- If blank graph, redirect to trackers to fill in data
- Focus on Individual Graphs page first, then have separate tab for Physical Activity, Health Measures, and Healthy Eating with their respective graphs and professional feedback (possibly sub-tabs under Individual Graphs tab?)
- First time using Weekly Challenges their should be a button to join groups
- First person to click join group names it and is group leader, subsequent individuals who join can join their group or join new group which starts a new group for them
- Possibly limit number of people allowed in a group and more group leader control (low priority)
- No intense graphics or animations
- Three tables in SQL for consent, permission, and privacy (this is how we will create defaults for each user)
