## General Meeting Notes
### General Project Discussion

- Goals and about the project
  -The new project's goal is to develop a food tracking system with a dashboard that allows different practitioners to track the food donated and present some metrics
  - basically an online calculator that helps organizations track their waste stats and displays it in different modes and graphs
  - Half of food going into food banks is wasted, goal is to save food from going to the waste fill, and have it donated to other use instead
  - Displays graphics that illustrates food waste trends to users
  - Do a dashboard with trackers/measures, allow user to choose a collection of them, then display corresponding graphics
  - Metric/tracker page for food donations
  - Graphs page with graphics and charts
  - We are tracking where the food waste is going (compost, for farmers, drying, etc.)
  - Trying to convince farmers to have bigger community compost
  - Allow businesses to visualize their food waste
  - Allow sharing of data so that other users can see what is wasted and coordinate food donations
  - Bi-annually calculate metrics for organizations to report to government/sponsors (use case 1)
  - Frequently update metrics and input data to visualize food waste (use case 2)
  - No limit on how many digits they can input, user’s responsibility to input valid data
  - Option to export SQL, csv or pdf of dashboard and stats
  - Option to change how data is displayed (line chart, bar chart, etc.)
  - Metrics: Fresh produce, frozen produce, canned produce/non-perishables 
  
- Data and architecture
  - The data will be collected from secondary public datasets
  - Teams can use same tech stack if we want for project (Django, MySQL)
  - Collect data from Google, look for metrics on what food is being wasted
  
- User groups
  - Project works with food banks, non-profits, etc. to help improve food systems
  - User roles: volunteers, manager, warehouse boss, sponsor, admin, experts
  - Stakeholders are employees, volunteers, companies who donate food, managers

- Network page
  - Connect organizations and share food waste data and graphics
  - New organizations will be asked for consent to be displayed in network of shared food waste data
    - This is optional, users can consent to whether or not they would like their stats shared

### Project Requirements
- First requirement will be creating different user accounts, create at least one basic metric and minimal dashboard tool for first peer testing
- Way to blog or chat with other users/businesses to coordinate food waste sharing or donations (bonus requirement)
  - E.g a blog where organizations can post what "leftovers" they have or post a request for certain item(s)

## Final Decisions/Conclusions
- Same tech stack and virtual machines as first project
- Do not need to re-do requirements report at this time

## Questions for Next Meeting
- What will the site's name be?
- Do you approve of our mock-up designs?

## Team Progress
- Created logs of agendas and meetings in GitHub repository
- Set up virtual machine on our machines and began working with Django CMS

## Action Items
- Group will find metrics to use on Google
- Group will create basic site mock-up for Barb's approval
- Group will set up basic framework of site and begin on user accounts requirement
- Barb will give us description of what she has done on the project
- Barb will work on thinking of a project name
