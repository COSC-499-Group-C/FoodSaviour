## General Meeting Notes
### General Project Goals and Discussion
- The new project's goal is to develop a food tracking system with a dashboard that allows different practitioners to track the food donated and present some metrics
- The data will be collected from secondary public datasets
- Teams can use same tech stack if we want for project (Django, MySQL)
- Project works with food banks, non-profits, etc. to help improve food systems
- Displays graphics that illustrates food waste trends to users
- Half of food going into food banks is wasted
- Do a dashboard with trackers/measures, allow user to choose a collection of them, then display corresponding graphics
- Metric/tracker page for food donations
- Graphs page with graphics and charts
- We are tracking where the food waste is going (compost, for farmers, drying, etc.)
- Trying to convince farmers to have bigger community compost
- Collect data from Google, look for metrics on what food is being wasted
- User roles: volunteers, manager, warehouse boss, sponsor, admin, experts
- Allow businesses to visualize their food waste
- Allow sharing of data so that other users can see what is wasted and coordinate food donations
- Bi-annually calculate metrics for organizations to report to government/sponsors (use case 1)
- Frequently update metrics and input data to visualize food waste (use case 2)
- No limit on how many digits they can input, userâ€™s responsibility to input valid data
- Option to export SQL or pdf of dashboard
- Option to change how data is displayed (line chart, bar chart, etc.)
- Stakeholders are employees, volunteers, companies who donate food, managers
- Network page to connect organizations and share food waste data and graphics
- New organizations will be asked for consent to be displayed in network of shared food waste data
- Metrics: Fresh produce, frozen produce, canned produce/non-perishables 

### Project Requirements
- First requirement will be creating different user accounts, create at least one basic metric and minimal dashboard tool for first peer testing
- Way to blog or chat with other users/businesses to coordinate food waste sharing or donations (bonus requirement)

## Final Decisions/Conclusions
- Same tech stack and virtual machines as first project
- Do not need to re-do requirements report at this time
