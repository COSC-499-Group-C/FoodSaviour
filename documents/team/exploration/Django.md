### About Django

Django is a free and open-source Python web development framework. Django uses a Model-Template-View framework for deployment. Overall, Django is very straightforward and robust in nature, making it one of the most popular framework worldwide due to the high scalibility

### Pros

- Efficient code structure and makeing it easier to add more functionalities to the platform (Highly Scalable)
- Uses Django Rest Framework (DRF), a flexible toolkit used to build Web APIs in Django
- REST (Representational state transfer) is the general framework, while DRF is a specific REST framework used in Django. This allows Django to have modular and customizable architecure, thus allowing to build and deploy Web APIs easier as compared to other frameworks
- Django emphasizes security by providing defense against [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) and [cross-site request forgery attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)
- The framework consists of the ORM (object-relational mapper), relational database, web templating system, and URL dispatchers. Where the ORM links between the models, HTTP requests handled by the relational database and. URL dispatcher is the controller based on regular expressions
- Django provides the rest framework with powerful API functionality. The rest framework has a built-in API browser for testing endpoints and Django with rest framework provides facility of authentication and permission rules with the framework
- Django supports more than 2500 packages with the solution of the problem on which this does not work. This can be helpful in extending the behaviour of the framework

### Cons

- Django is cumbersome software and can limit development speed because of the many reusable modules. It also needs to make sure that previous versions are still compatible with new releases, contributing to its slow nature
- Django offers a lots of libraries for development but they are not flexible and cannot be customized
- Django is not appropriate for small projects with few features because the complex functionality of the framework

### Use Cases

Django can tackle projects of any size and capacity and aims for high-performance websites. This frameworks is mostly used for:
- High load booking engines
- Shopping platforms
- School management systems
- IOS and Android applications supporting web-based applications
