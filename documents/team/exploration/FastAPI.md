### About FastAPI

Fast API is a modern, open-source, fast, and highly performant Python web framework used for building Web APIs and is based on Python 3.6

### Pros

- Fast API validates the developer’s data type even in deeply nested JSON requests
- Fast API is built on standards like JSON Schema (a tool used for validating the structure of JSON data), OAuth 2.0 (it’s the industry-standard protocol for authorization), and OpenAPI (which is a publicly available application programming interface)
- FastAPI makes it easy to build a GraphQL API with a Python library called graphene-python
- The primary focus of the FastAPI are, in Fast development, Fewer bugs and High & fast performance
- Companies like Netflix and Uber use this framework which fully supports asynchronous programming and can run with WSGI(Web Server Gateway interface) and ASGI(Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)
- FastAPI integrates well with OAuth 2.0 and external providers
- It gives the autocomplete feature which helps in producing applications with less amount of effort and also less time in debugging.

### Cons

- Because FastAPI is relatively new, the community is small compared to other frameworks
- Since in the development of the applications we need to tie everything together in the FastAPI application which causes the main file to become very long or crowded

### Use Cases

Fast API's main priortiy is speed. Video hosting websites like Netflix uses it. It also scales perfectly in deploying production-ready machine learning models because ML models work best in production when they are wrapped around a REST API and deployed in a microservice.
