# QA Bug Tracking Tools

## GitHub/GitHub Issues
- GitHub Issues is a tool built in to your GitHub repository that allows you to plan your project, track issues, and follow your progress.
- It allows team members to create issues for whatever tasks or chores that need to be completed.
- Users can further refine these issues by adding appropriate tags to them to help identify the type of issue and creating sub-tasks from main features.
- Pull requests in GutHub also add an extra layer of quality assurance to our code by allowing other team members to review your code before it is pushed.
- Reviewers can view your changes and comment on specific lines of code if they identify a bug or needed change before approving.
- GitHub Issues is also how we recieve marks for our project and is what Gitstats tracks, so using this method would allow us to track bugs while recieving credit for it.
- GitHub Issues, along with our unit tests and pull request reviews, should suffice for quality assurance and bug tracking.

## Jira
- Jira is a simple project management tool that can be used for tracking bugs and creating issues.
- It comes with a project template for bug tracking in particular.
- This would be similar to GitHub Issues, but could allow users/clients to have bug reporting privileges without having to give them access to your entire GitHub repository.
- Jira is free for up to 10 users.

## BugHerd
- BugHerd is an easy-to-use bug tracking tool that allows for user acceptance testing, so users can make sure their website is fit for purpose.
- It lets users pin feedback directly to website as they are reviewing and snaps a screenshot of the bug alongside the user's operating system and browser.
- It is easy to set up: either put some Javascript code in the head section of your website or have all users install a BugHerd extension.
- BugHerd can be integrated with GitHub, so that bug reports in BugHerd automatically show up as issues in GitHub Issues.
- BugHerd is NOT a free software and requires a subscription.
