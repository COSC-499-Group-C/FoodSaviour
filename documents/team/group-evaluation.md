# Group Evaluation 

## Equifood

### Team A
#### Questions:
 1. If the platform itself does not deliver, then does that mean the restaurants are responsible for delivering the food? Or the customers are responsible for picking up the food?
 2. How will the platform profit if no payments or transactions are made on the platform?
#### Comments:
 1. Presentation went over time a lot, it seems like it was just reading the presentation slides directly and there were no paraphrasing at all. It would be helpful if you could reduce the paragraphs to bullet points and paraphrase them so the audience can follow more easily along.
 2. Could practice more on talking louder and clearer during the presentation as it was hard to hear despite being on the front rows.
### Team B
#### Questions:
 1. Is this platform like an "ordering" service platform then? Users "buy" online then pay in person and collect the food in person? Since there will be no delivery or transactions made online.
 2. How can you prevent users from "pranking" and ordering food and not showing up? Are there penalties for if they don't show up to pick up the food?
#### Comments:
 1. Could improve by simplifying both level 0 and level 1 DFDs so it is clearer to see and follow.
 2. A bit overtime on the presentation, could watch the time.
### Team C
#### Questions:
 1. Can users make payments directly online? Since there were mentions about the donations, it is quite unclear what 'donations' mean in this case.
 2. How are you guys going to enforce security for the transactions on your app?
#### Comments:
 1. Project never elaborated on the budget of the developement
 2. Overall the presentation felt very smooth, I would have love to see a section for future development plan as just 'picking-up' is not enough in today's competitive market. Given they will sort of compete with giants like Skip the Dishes and Doordash

#### Questions:
 1. Will wood come pre-cut or not? Will there be an option to choose?
