## Goals for this week

## Overall to-do list for this week

    - Overview repo and create issues to keep everyone on task
- @Mitch:
    - Prepare next client meeting agenda

## Questions and Answers
- @Paul: What are the folders in "team" folder in the repository?
  - @Sydney: I created those folder to separate the team meeting minutes from the team agenda. That way if we look back we can easily find the agenda and matching minutes and compare what we did and kind of what happened that week.
- @Anshul: Are there enough pages in the project for us to do?
  - @Sydney: I think that is up to the client to decide. In the end if the client only has a few things for us to do, our only goal is to complete them. This project teaches us to be more client-oriented rather than focus what we like, but good question!
