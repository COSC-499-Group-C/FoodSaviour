We’re waiting for her to compare our tech stack documents but we’re hoping to use fastAPI for backend and django for front end

  

**Are there any problems this week with the other groups?**
No, this week was much better.

*Let her know if she needs to ever intervene again if there’s communication issues.*

  

**Any problems with the client or gitstats?**
No, everything is good at the moment.

*For this week, make sure we’re hitting above a 20 individual score.*
