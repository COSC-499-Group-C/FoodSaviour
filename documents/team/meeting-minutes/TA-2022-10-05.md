# TA Meeting Minutes 2022-10-05

## TA Questions

**Have you figured out the features that you need?**
- Kind of, our client wants to have different health trackers like heart rate, blood pressure and living habits etc, as well as create a discussion board. We’re going to make a requirements report and send it to her for her approval

**Have you figured out which tech stack you’re going to use?** 
- We’re waiting for her to compare our tech stack documents but we’re hoping to use fastAPI for backend and django for front end

**Are there any problems this week with the other groups?**
- No, this week was much better.
- *Let her know if she needs to ever intervene again if there’s communication issues.*  

**Any problems with the client or gitstats?**
- No, everything is good at the moment.
- *For this week, make sure we’re hitting above a 20 individual score for gitstat*
