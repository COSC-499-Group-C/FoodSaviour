# TA Meeting minute 2022-10-26

## General discussion

### What did you work on last week?
We worked on finalizing and submitting the requirement document, submitting the peer evaluation, group evaluation, and our first draft of the Figma mock up for our client.

### What will you work on this week?
We plan to begin programming on the front end of the website. As of now we are still waiting for our client to create the individual directories for each team so that we can start testing deployment of the website to make sure everything is alright.
We will also make sure that everyone has setup their SSH login so they can have access to the Ubuntu.

### Are there any problems or blockers?
We were all quite sick last week, but besides that there are no other blockers and we are all now pretty much recovered.
