# TA Meeting Minutes 2022-11-04

## General Discussion 

### What did you work on this past week?
This week we all worked on setting up our working environments for the project. We now all have DjangoCMS, the MySQL database, and our virtual environments set up to run the project thanks to Anshul researching and helping all of us set it up correctly. We also started testing out DjangoCMS to see what it's like just to get our bearings.

### What will you work on this week?
This week, we will work on the Gantt charts, basic django pages for the site, and Barb has also required us to research into food metrics a bit and make a document to submit to her. 

### Was there any drawbacks this week, other than the project being changed?
Not really, we all had specific issues setting everything up for Django, but they were all ironed out and we now all have it working.
